# Arcade Simulator

This project was created for the 1-Day Game Hackathon of 2024 at Zetland House. We created an arcade game simulator that plays a sequence of classic games: **Pong**, **Asteroid**, and **Pacman**. After each game finishes, the next one in the sequence is automatically launched.

### Pong
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The game consists of two paddles, with a ball bouncing between them. Players score points by sending the ball past their opponent's paddle.

### Asteroid
In Asteroid, the player controls a spaceship that must navigate through space, avoiding or shooting down asteroids. The goal is to survive and destroy as many asteroids as possible without being hit.

### Pacman
Pacman is a maze game where the player controls Pacman, who must eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding being caught by ghosts. Power pellets allow Pacman to temporarily eat the ghosts for extra points.


## Features
- Sequential game-playing functionality: Pong → Asteroid → Pacman
- Smooth transition between games
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and updates
- Code designed using object-oriented principles

## Requirements
To run the arcade simulator, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

Install the requirements using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone this Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arcade-simulator.git
```

Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd arcade-simulator
cd pong 
```

Run the game from the pong file:
```bash
python main.py
```

### MRS_Pacwoman 
  if you played the other games and the set up went smoothly try mrs_pacwoman. Its the same game rules just different sprites(images used for the characters/objects)
  you can run it if you 
  ```bash
  cd mrs_pacwoman
  python run.py
  ```
